           <p id="firstletter" class="para">Wildlife are animals that have not been domesticated by humans. This does not mean that wild animals live without human interference. Humans control, manage, manipulate, use, and kill wildlife for various reasons. Humans tend to think of wild animals in terms of the threat they pose to people or the value they hold for them.
             Some wildlife threaten human safety, health, property, and/or quality of life. This is true of large carnivores (such as lions, tigers, and alligators), poisonous snakes and spiders, disease-carrying animals, and animals that endanger moving vehicles. In addition, there are carnivores (such as coyotes and bobcats) that prey on livestock and pets, herbivores that eat crops and lawns, beavers that dam up streams, and wild animals that invade or damage human spaces. Many rodents, skunks, rabbits, deer, and birds are considered nuisance animals.</p>
            <p  class="para">However, many wild animals, even dangerous ones, have value to humans. This value might be economic, educational, or emotional in nature. Valuable wildlife fall into the following categories:</p>
            <ol >
                <li  class="para"> Wild animals that produce products people want to eat, wear, or use.</li><br>
                <li  class="para"> Wild animals that humans kill for sport through hunting or fishing.</li><br>
                <li  class="para"> Wild animals that can be manipulated to do labor or entertain people. </li><br>
                <li  class="para"> Wild animals that humans enjoy watching, hearing, feeding, or photographing. </li><br>
                <li  class="para"> Wild animals that are useful in scientific and medical research. These include primates and some strains of rats, mice, and rabbits.</li>

        <div>
            <p  class="para">Prehistoric humans constantly struggled with wildlife. Both sides were sometimes predators and sometimes prey, but humans quickly tipped the balance in their favor with two big advantages: superior intellect and weapons. As humans gained more control over nature, they began using wild animals not just as a food source but as a source of labor and entertainment. Elephants became beasts of burden. Mongooses and birds of prey were trained to be hunting assistants. Some lions, tigers, and bears were kept in cages to entertain or educate humans. Dangerous animals that could not be contained were often eliminated.</p>
